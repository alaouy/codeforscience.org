      <div class="content-text-intro">Dat is a grant-funded, open-source, decentralized data sharing tool for efficiently versioning and syncing changes to data.</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">Built in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, Dat can be used to version data locally, or to share and sync data over the internet. Dat includes an optional peer-to-peer distribution system, meaning that the more widely that a dataset is shared, the faster it is for users to retrieve or sync a copy, and the more redundant that the dataset’s availability becomes.</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">By building tools to build and share data pipelines, we aim to bring to data a style of collaboration similar to what Git brings to source code, while bringing a style of sharing similar to what Dropbox brings to file generally.</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">Note that while Dat is a designed as a general-purpose tool, our team focuses on its use in the sciences.</div>

      <div class="content-text-intro">History</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">The first code went into Dat <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/commit/e5eda57b53f60b05c0c3d97da90c10cd17dcbe19">on August 17, 2013</a>. The first six months were spent making a prototype (thanks to the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201346305/">John S. and James L. Knight foundation Prototype Fund</a>), followed by taking Dat beyond the prototype phase and into an alpha release.</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">In the spring of 2014 we were able to expand the team working on Dat from one to three people, thanks to <a href="https://usopendata.org/2014/04/02/dat">support from the Alfred P. Sloan foundation</a>. Sloan’s proposition was that they like the initial Dat prototype, but wanted to see scientific data use cases be treated as top priority. As a result we expanded the scope of the project from its tabular data specific beginnings, and have focused on adding features that will help us work with larger open scientific datasets. <a href="https://usopendata.org/2015/04/03/sloan/">Sloan redoubled their support in the spring of 2015</a>, allowing us to continue to fund three positions for another two years.</div>

      <div class="content-text-paragraph">In the winter of 2016, the <a href="http://dat-data.com/blog/2016-02-01-announcing-publicbits">Knight Foundation provided significant funding to create a centralized registry for Dat-hosted datasets</a>, towards creating a global data commons. That allowed the project to create three new positions.</div>
